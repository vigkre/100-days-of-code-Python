# Hurdles race Reeborg has entered a hurdle race, but he does not know in advance how long the race is. Make him run
# the course, following a path similar to the one shown, but stopping at the only flag that will be shown after the
# race has started. What you need to know The functions move() and turn_left(). The condition at_goal() and its
# negation. How to use a while loop. Your program should also be valid for world Hurdles 1.
